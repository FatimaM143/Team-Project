           <h2>About Us</h2>
           <h7> We are Leeds Corn Exchange.</h7>

           <br>And we have been doing things differently for decades. <br>
           <br>We are a family fuelled by independence. Not just shopkeepers, but creatives,
             collectors, cooks and craftspeople. Home to a collection of vendors who do things their own way,
             and a community of customers who prefer the personal touch.<br><br>
             We are a living Leeds landmark. A beacon of creativity shining against the mainstream.
             A historic centre of commerce, reimagined for a new century. Generation upon generation of
             memories. Shopping bags full of stories. Eccentricity ingrained into the Victorian stonework.
             <br><br> We are all that and more. And our doors are wide open.
