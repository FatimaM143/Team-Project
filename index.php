    <h3> We’re Leeds Corn Exchange.</h3>
    <h7>
    <br>And we’ve been doing things differently for decades. <br>
    <br>We’re a family fuelled by independence. Not just shopkeepers, but creatives,
      collectors, cooks and craftspeople. Home to a collection of vendors who do things their own way,
      and a community of customers who prefer the personal touch.<br><br>
      We’re a living Leeds landmark. A beacon of creativity shining against the mainstream.
      A historic centre of commerce, reimagined for a new century. Generation upon generation of
      memories. Shopping bags full of stories. Eccentricity ingrained into the Victorian stonework.
      <br><br> We’re all that and more. And our doors are wide open.
    </h7>
